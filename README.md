# BPI2017 challenge - process discovery 

Welcome to our Bank Application Process Discovery repository! This project was aimed at conducting a comprehensive analysis of the BPI2017 challenge of bank applications to unearth intriguing relationships, identify bottlenecks, and derive value-driven insights from data.

## Project Overview

Our project is divided into two key phases:

1. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: We started off by analyzing the dataset - applying a series of filters, performing outlier detection, and carrying out feature selection. This enabled us to identify promising patterns, trends, and correlations within the data.

2. **Process Discovery and Modeling**: Using the insights obtained from the first phase, we built several Petri nets models, fine-tuned them and finally found the one that best represented the data. The Petri nets were assessed based on various evaluation metrics including the fitness of the log file to the model.

All these stages have been thoroughly documented in a comprehensive report that encapsulates the entire process along with important observations and recommendations for the bank.

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the following main elements:

- **Code**: All codes related to the project can be found in the  notebook. They are organized in Jupyter notebooks which include the filters, visualizations, and Petri nets generation.
- **Data**: You'll find both the original dataset and the modified datasets post-filtering in the `data` directory.
- **Report**: A comprehensive report detailing our methodology, findings, and recommendations is included in this repository in the form of a PDF.
